# line 1 indicates the starting volume
# line 2 indicates the starting tempo
# line 3 is the MIDI instrument. 0 corresponds to the grand piano.

# the music begins following the first three lines
# you can define procedures or employ any of the funcs
# alternatively, you can type in a series of notes (e.g., A4 B4 C5) followed by its note duration
# the note duration is calculated based off the tempo, which is initialized here to 64
# 1 corresponds to a QUARTER note, and everything else should be adjusted accordingly
# in other words, 2 is a half note, and 4 would be a full measure (if 4/4)
# rests can be employed using volume 0, note + note duration, volume x
# defining procedures for rest lengths may be a good idea
# here's the beginning of howl's moving castle

# we use a repeat in the beginning
# note that repeating repeats n times after the first,
# so be careful regarding the repeat amount

# we want to play this pattern three times so we repeat it twice
